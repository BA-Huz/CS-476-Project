/*
    The following update function is intended to compinsate for a weird bug
    that may or may not exist where after a prolonged time in game an egg spawns
    at the coop position yet this seems impossible via code and may be because
    we are the big dumb and spawned an egg on the coop by accident when choosing egg
    locations. Attatch this code snippet to the EggInitilizer script
